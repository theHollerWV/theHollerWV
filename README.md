- 👋 Hi, I’m @theHollerWV ... despite being a bit long in tooth, I keep getting called Noob by little homies.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... AI, homesteading, home-based food production, dogs, and people.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... everything!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... developing a systematic hybrid methodology for categorizing, cataloging, archiving, and retrieving AI session data.
- 📫 How to reach me ... x.com/theHollerWV (best).
- 😄 Pronouns: ... Thou, thee, thy, thine, thyself, in historical context.
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... opinions > fact: "fun fact, there is no fun fact"? Surely, there must be some fun facts.
